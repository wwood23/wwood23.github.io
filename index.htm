	<h1>NATHAN FIELDER FAN PAGE</h1>
	<div style= "background-color:orange"
	<p>Nathan Fielder was born on May 12th, 1983, in Vancouver, British 
Columbia. He is best known for his marvelously hilarious hit series 
<I>Nathan For You</I>. His humor is a perfect mix of awkward cringe humor 
along with dashes of deadpan delivery. His show features a variety of the 
strangest people <abbr title="Los Angeles">LA</abbr> County has to offer. I 
think that it is one of 
the best television shows of the decade</p>

<p>Sadly, Nathan's show is now over. For some reason, he decided that four 
seasons of the show was enough, and announced that he will no longer do 
<I>Nathan For You</I> earlier this year.</p></div>

<p> Nathan ended his show after trying to find the long lost love of one of his favorite guests Francis. The series finale in a large variety of different ways. <hr></hr> Most noticeable, was the fact that this episode was <b>2 hours</b> compared to the normal length of 30 minutes. Secondly, it plays with the idea of Nathan finding love himself </p></div>
